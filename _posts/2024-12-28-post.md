- Types of money: (1) Fiat currency (govt issued paper, $24t); (2) Bank deposits (created by commercial banks, not the govt! an IOU from a bank, 15.5t); (3) central bank reserves (issued by fed that only commercial banks can hold; an IOU from fed, 3t); (4) Treasuries (20t).
- Prior to 2008, Feb conducts a reserve scarcity regime where it controlled short-term interest rates by making slight adjustement to the level of reserves in the banking system, 30b. Today, fed controls short-term interest rate by adjusting hte interest it pays bnks on excess reserves and the offering rate of the Overnight Reserve Repo Facility, a program where the participants can loan money to the fed.
- *Currency in circulation*: cumulative reserves that have been converted to currency.
- *Foreign official and internation accounts*: checking account for foreign central banks, who deposit their dollars at NY fed as a secured repo loan. It doesn't hold reserves but instead hold a repo loan. 
- *Teasury General Account (TGA)*: Treasury's checking account. When tax are paid, reserves leave commercial banking system and enter into TGA.
- *Central Bank Digital Currencies*: The idea is to allow everyone to have an account at central bank. It will give the govt complete control of the monetary system, e.g. debet/credit money to anyone's account at will or lower/raise interest rate of anyone at will.
- *Treasuries*: unsecured debt issued by the federal govt, an easy way to store large amounts of money.
- *Residential Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)*: guaranteed by the govt.
- Bemindful of the March 2020 Treasury sell rush episode.
- Most currency is actually held aboard, and 80% of the 2t in circulation is held in the form of $100 bills.
- The level of central bank reserves held by banks is determined by the fed and is unaffected by the amount of loans made by commerial banks. Similarly, the level of bank deposits in the banking system is largely determined by the collective actions of commercial banks. Bank deposits are created when a commercial bank purchases an asset or creates a loan.
