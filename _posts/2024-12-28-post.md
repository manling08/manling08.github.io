Types of money: (1) Fiat currency (govt issued paper, $24t); (2) Bank deposits (created by commercial banks, not the govt! an IOU from a bank, 15.5t); (3) central bank reserves (issued by fed that only commercial banks can hold; an IOU from fed, 3t); (4) Treasuries (20t).

Chapter 1 Money and Banking
- Prior to 2008, Feb conducts a reserve scarcity regime where it controlled short-term interest rates by making slight adjustement to the level of reserves in the banking system, 30b. Today, fed controls short-term interest rate by adjusting hte interest it pays bnks on excess reserves and the offering rate of the Overnight Reserve Repo Facility, a program where the participants can loan money to the fed.
- *Currency in circulation*: cumulative reserves that have been converted to currency.
- *Foreign official and internation accounts*: checking account for foreign central banks, who deposit their dollars at NY fed as a secured repo loan. It doesn't hold reserves but instead hold a repo loan. 
- *Teasury General Account (TGA)*: Treasury's checking account. When tax are paid, reserves leave commercial banking system and enter into TGA.
- *Central Bank Digital Currencies*: The idea is to allow everyone to have an account at central bank. It will give the govt complete control of the monetary system, e.g. debet/credit money to anyone's account at will or lower/raise interest rate of anyone at will.
- *Treasuries*: unsecured debt issued by the federal govt, an easy way to store large amounts of money.
- *Residential Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)*: guaranteed by the govt.
- Bemindful of the March 2020 Treasury sell rush episode.
- Most currency is actually held aboard, and 80% of the 2t in circulation is held in the form of $100 bills.
- The level of central bank reserves held by banks is determined by the fed and is unaffected by the amount of loans made by commerial banks. Similarly, the level of bank deposits in the banking system is largely determined by the collective actions of commercial banks. Bank deposits are created when a commercial bank purchases an asset or creates a loan.

Chapter 2 Money Creators
- When r* is very low, Fed will do everything it can to get interest rate below r*: (1) cut target overnight interest rate to zero;(2) lower longer-term interest rates by buying lots of longer-dated treasury securities via Open Market Desk (the "Desk").
- The desk collects market intelligence through a wide network of contacts including primary/small dealers, commercial banks, govt-sponsored enterprises, hedge funds, pension gunds, corporate treasurers.
- When the fed buys a financial asset from a non-bank, it pays the reserves to a commercial bank who in term creates bank deposits. QE essentially converts treasuries into bank deposits and reserves. Forced to trade in their Treasuries for bank deposits, the nonbanks can trade their bank deposits for higher-yielding corp debt or equity.
- The Feb purchases a few trillions in assets, which is a fraction of US GDP, while BOJ has purchased assets amounting to over 100% of Japan's GDP. Hence Japanese bond market is destroyed, and only reflects the dictates of Japanese policy makers.
- Commercial banks have retail deposits and wholesale (i.e. institutional) deposits. It faces two fundametnal problems: solvency to ensure the bank deposits are backed by sound loans, liquidity to ensure those deposits are freely convertible.
- In today's fractional reserve banking system, a commercial bank only needs $5 of its own money to create $100 loans and deposits.
- How to study banks: At individual bank level, US bank publicly report detailed balance sheet data every quarter on their call reports to Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (Form FFIEC). At national level, Fed aggregate data every week through H8 data release. On Global level, Bank of International Settlements aggregate data every quarter.
- Treasury does not decide HOW MUCH debt to issue, that is determined by the federal govt's deficit, which is a result of decisions by congress. Treasury decide HOW it will go about funding the deficit.
- Central bank reserves are backed by the safe assets they purchased, bank deposits are backed by loans, but treasury is backed by nothingb ut the confidence in US govt.

Chapter 3 - Shadow Banks
- Primary dealers have the priviledge of trading directly with the Fed. They fund inventory of financial products by borrowing in the repo market using the financial products as collateral. These are typically overnight loans that they renews everyday until they are able to find a buyer for the product. There are currently 24 primary dealers, almost all affiliated with large banks.
- Dealers also borrow from one client to lend to another. For example, borrow on an overnight basis from its investors client using the same collaterals to make a one-month repo loan to its hedge fund client, and earn the interest difference.
- During Covid-19, primary dealers borrowed around $400 billion from the Fed to pay for assets their shadow bank clients (e.g. hedge funds, RETS, ETFs) were desperate to sell and scramble for cash.
- Money Market Fund (MMF) types: govt MMF and prime MMF (which also invests in non-govt securities e.g. foreign commercial banks)
- ETF is shadow bank becuase while its shares can be sold any time the market is open, the assets the ETF holds may not be as liquid.
- Mortgage REITS (mREITs) buy mortgage securities that mature in 15 to 30 years using one-month repo loans that are continuouslly renewed. They are very subject to bank run risk when they are unable to renew their repo loans.
- Private investment funds borrow medium term and invest in long term, to avoid fire sales. However, some funds do employe more aggressive strategies that rely on short-term borrowing.
- Lastly securitization...

Chapter 4 - Eurodollar market
- Eurodollars are US dollars held outside the US.
- Around 50% of global trade is invoiced in USD, and about 40% international payments are made in USD.
- Liquidity. Australian banks find it easier to borrow in USD even when they want to invest in Australian dollar assets and then enter into a USD for Australian dolloar swap trade.
- Offshore dollar market comprises (1) offshore dollar banking and (2) offshore dollar capital markets.
- *Offshore dollar banking system* is around $10t, about 1/3 of global dollar banking system. It comprises of (1) regulatory-arbitrage segments e.g. offshore banking in Cayman Islands to evade onshore banking regulatio; (2) dollar banking needs of foreigners. In recent years, most offshore dollar banking flows do not involve the US at all, e.g. a Japanese bank offering a dollar loan to a Korean company. Foreigners want dollars, so the offshore bank *creates* dollars for them to hold.
- Domestic banks can rely on stable retial deposits, while offshore banks must manage funding via money markets and FX swaps, which makes them more susceptible to bank runs.
- A foreign bank creates dollars by (1) having a Fed account (large banks); (2) using dollar deposits at a US bank to settle interbank payments (small banks), i.e. the bank deposits are as if fed reserves without limit.
- Basel III following 2008 Financial Crisis made banks safers by forcing them to hold more high-quality liquid assets like treasury and encourage them to have more reliable liabilities （such as retail deposits than borrowings from institutional investors in money markets).
- In pandemic, Fed became lender of last resort to foreign banks via FX-swap lines, where the Fed lends dollars to a foreign central bank, who in tern lends to the foreign banks within their jurisdiction.

Chapter 5 - Interest rates
- Fed theoretically controls short-term interest rates through its *control over fed funds rate (FFR)*, which is the rate commercial banks pay to take out an overnight loan for *reserves* on an unsecured basis. Historically, Fed's trading desk would estimate the demand curve for reserves and adjust the amount of reserves inte hbanking system to maintain the fed fund rate within target range. However, this has became obsolete when Fed started QE (which increased the reserves from 20b to a few t, and made it impossible to control quantity of reserves).
- Fed currently controls short-term interest rates by *adjusting the interest rate it offers on Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)* and the *interest it pays on the reserves* that banks hold in their Fed account (prior to the cirsis the Fed didn't pay interst on reserves).
- RRP: Money market funds, primary dealers, commercial banks, and a few govt-sponsored enterprises can lend ris-free to the Fed at the RRP offering rate puts a floors on the returns they are willing to accept from the private sector.
- Commercial banks may perceive federal funds as a cheap source of funding, driving FFR to trade above interest on reserves. But they still look to interest on reserves as a reference rate. 
- In practice RRP (offered to a wide range of market participants) is a much more influencial rate than FFR (available only to commercial banks).
- Long-term interst rate considerations: (1) how the Fed will set short-term interest rates in the future; (2) estimates for future inflation, (3) how volatile those estimates are, (4) future supply and demand dynamics of treasury debt issuance.
- A common framework for long-term interest rates is: expectation for the path of short-term interst rates plus a term premium.
- The short-term interest rate futures market offers a glimpse of what the market thinks short-term interest rates will be in the future.
- It is market's best guess of what future 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rates will be (since LIBOR was discontinued in 2023).
