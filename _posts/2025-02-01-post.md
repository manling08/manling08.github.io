Chapter 1: What is economics
- Economics is a study of the economy rather than rational human choice.
- Money is a symbol of what others in the society owe you, or your claim on particular amounts of the society's resources.
- The most common way to get money is to have a job. To understand jobs, we need to know about skills, technological innovation and international trade.
- There are lots of transfers of money in the ecoconmy.
- In standard economics textbooks, there is little recognition of production, e.g. how the factory is organized, how to control workers or deal with trade unions, and how to systematically improve tech via research.

Chapter 2: Capitalism 1774 and 2014
- Adam Smith: ultimate source of increase in wealth lies in the increase in productivity through greater division of labor.
- Capitalism is an economy in which production is organized in pursuit of profit rather than for own consumption. It is organized by capitalist, who own cpital goods (or means of production).
- In Smith's time, most people did not work for capitalists, and child labor is perfectly fine. Today in rich countries, about 10% are self-employe, 15-25% work for the government, and the rest work for capitalists.
- In Smith's time, Markets were largely local except for key commodities that were traded internationalls (e.g. sugar, slaves, or spices). The small-scal firms creates perfect competition. Most banks issued their own notes to a particular person with a unique value and was signed by the cashier issuing it. It was only in 1759 that Bank of England started issuing fixed-denomination notes. And in late 18th century (Smith time) fully printed notes were issued. 
- Gold standard means the paper money issued by central bank is freely exchangeable with a specified weight of gold/silver. The US Fed kept gold equivalent to 40% of the value of currency it issued.
- 3/4 of French didn't have access to banks (saving and borrowing) until 1860s. Stock markets had been in existence for a couple of centuries by Smith's time.
- However great an economic theory it may be, it is specific to its time and space. To apply it fruitfully, we need a good knowledge of the tech nad institutional forces that characterize the particular segment we try to analyze.

Chapter 3: A brief history of capitalism
- Pre-capitalist societies changed very slowly with income per capita growing at 0.12% per year.
- 1500-1820 "The dawn of capitalism": Britain and Netherlands achieved per capita economic growth of 0.28% per year (while the rest of Europe still hovered around 0.14%), feautured by advancedments in cotton textiles and iron. It lay culture shifts towards maths, sciences, systemization of knowledge that made tech breakthrough less dependent on individuals and more transferable. And colonialism started.
- 1820-1870 "Industrial revolution": Per capita income in Western Europe grew at 1%, intially accompanied by a fall in living standards for many. Some with old skills were replaced by machines and had to work for factories for 70-80 hours per week. Rise of anti-apitalists movements arose with some tried to turn the clock back and others (e.g. Robert Owen) sought to build a better society via voluntary associations. Karl Marx suggested scientific socialism that take advantage of production units created by capitalism, abolish private ownership, and introduce central planning. British as the prioneer of protectionism and US as the champion of it ("infant industry argument"). Free trade spreads mostly through unfree means.
- 1870-1913 "High noon": New tech emerged through systematic application of scientific and engineering principles, rather than practical men with good intuition. Limited liability company, bankruptcy law, central bank, welfare state, regulated working conditions and others emerged along the way. Bank of England strated in 1844 to tackle bank failure and financial system stability. Persuit of "balanced budget".
- 1914-1945 "The turmoil": The WWI discredited the then popular view that the thickening web of commerce would make wars between nations thus intertwined highly unlikely. The Russian Revolution was an even bigger shock to the defenders of capitalism than WWI. The Great Depression of 1929 (it wasn't until 1937 that US output regained its 1929 level) where the demand level spiraled down and government was the only one that can spend more by running a budget deficit. Income tax was introduced in Sweden in 1932 (so late!).  
- 1945-1973 "Golden age of capitalism": Per capita income in Western Europe grew at 4.1% per year, US grew at 2.5%, and Japan grew at 8.1%.
