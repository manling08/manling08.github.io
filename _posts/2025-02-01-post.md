We all need to know sth about the diverse approaches to economics so that we do not become passive victims of someone else's decision, that we effectively resist those who try to polarize every debate, and tell us "there is no alternative". 人需自救。

Chapter 1: What is economics
- Economics is a study of the economy rather than rational human choice.
- Money is a symbol of what others in the society owe you, or your claim on particular amounts of the society's resources.
- The most common way to get money is to have a job. To understand jobs, we need to know about skills, technological innovation and international trade.
- In standard economics textbooks, there is little recognition of production, e.g. how the factory is organized, how to control workers or deal with trade unions, and how to systematically improve tech via research.

Chapter 2: Capitalism 1774 and 2014
- Adam Smith: ultimate source of increase in wealth lies in the increase in productivity through greater division of labor.
- Capitalism is an economy in which production is organized in pursuit of profit rather than for own consumption. It is organized by capitalist, who own capital goods (or means of production).
- In Smith's time, most people did not work for capitalists, and child labor is perfectly fine. Today in rich countries, about 10% are self-employe, 15-25% work for the government, and the rest work for capitalists.
- In Smith's time, Markets were largely local except for key commodities that were traded internationalls (e.g. sugar, slaves, or spices). The small-scal firms creates perfect competition. Most banks issued their own notes to a particular person with a unique value and was signed by the cashier issuing it. It was only in 1759 that Bank of England started issuing fixed-denomination notes. And in late 18th century (Smith time) fully printed notes were issued. 
- Gold standard means the paper money issued by central bank is freely exchangeable with a specified weight of gold/silver. The US Fed kept gold equivalent to 40% of the value of currency it issued.
- 3/4 of French didn't have access to banks (saving and borrowing) until 1860s. Stock markets had been in existence for a couple of centuries by Smith's time.
- However great an economic theory it may be, it is specific to its time and space. To apply it fruitfully, we need a good knowledge of the tech nad institutional forces that characterize the particular segment we try to analyze.

Chapter 3: A brief history of capitalism
- Pre-capitalist societies changed very slowly with income per capita growing at 0.12% per year.
- 1500-1820 "The dawn of capitalism": Britain and Netherlands achieved per capita economic growth of 0.28% per year (while the rest of Europe still hovered around 0.14%), feautured by advancedments in cotton textiles and iron. It lay culture shifts towards maths, sciences, systemization of knowledge that made tech breakthrough less dependent on individuals and more transferable. And colonialism started.
- 1820-1870 "Industrial revolution": Per capita income in Western Europe grew at 1%, intially accompanied by a fall in living standards for many. Some with old skills were replaced by machines and had to work for factories for 70-80 hours per week. Rise of anti-capitalists movements arose with some tried to turn the clock back and others (e.g. Robert Owen) sought to build a better society via voluntary associations. Karl Marx suggested scientific socialism that take advantage of production units created by capitalism, abolish private ownership, and introduce central planning. British as the prioneer of protectionism and US as the champion of it ("infant industry argument"). Free trade spreads mostly through unfree means.
- 1870-1913 "High noon": New tech emerged through systematic application of scientific and engineering principles, rather than practical men with good intuition. Limited liability company, bankruptcy law, central bank, welfare state, regulated working conditions and others emerged along the way. Bank of England strated in 1844 to tackle bank failure and financial system stability. Persuit of "balanced budget".
- 1914-1945 "The turmoil": The WWI discredited the then popular view that the thickening web of commerce would make wars between nations thus intertwined highly unlikely. The Russian Revolution was an even bigger shock to the defenders of capitalism than WWI. The Great Depression of 1929 (it wasn't until 1937 that US output regained its 1929 level) where the demand level spiraled down and government was the only one that can spend more by running a budget deficit. Income tax was introduced in Sweden in 1932 (so late!).  
- 1945-1973 "Golden age of capitalism": Per capita income in Western Europe grew at 4.1% per year, US grew at 2.5%, and Japan grew at 8.1%. Many new tech developed for military purposes had civilian uses, e.g. computers, radar, jet engines, microwaves, etc. 1944 Bretton Woods Institutions i.e. IMF, IBRD/World Bank. Many European countries took private enterprises into public ownership or set up new state-owned enterprises. Widespread decolonization.
- 1973-1979 "Interregnum": Suspension of USD-gold convertibility in 1971, followed by untangling of USD and other currencies at fixed rate, and then oil shock, and lastly stagflation.
- 1980-Today "Rise and fall of neo-liberalism": Margaret Thatcher as British prime minister in 1979 lowered high-rate income taxes, reduced govt spending, introduced laws reducing union power, abolished capital control, and privatize SOEs. Interest rates were raised to reduce inflation by dampening demand, which attracted foreign capital driving up value of British pound, making British export uncompetitive. Eventually leading to a hudge recession. Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan had done similar measures. The third world debt crisis emerged. Firms had to deliver profits faster than before to prevent investor sell off. Developing countries defaulted on foreign debts because of US interest rate rise. Extremely disappointing Bretton Woods instituions interventions. Only Chile did well out of the neo-liberal policies, and all other successes extensively used state intervention and liberalized only gradually, e.g. Japan and China. The collapse of socialism. Asian financial crisis. Dot com boom. Great moderation. "Keynesian spring" and the return of free-market orthodoxy, i.e. let huge budget deficits develop with a vengeance. Austerity budgets were imposed in UK, PIIGS, and even Obama govt. Use balancing budget to prune back welfare state. 2008 crisis.

Chapter 4: How to "do" economics
1. Classical school: The market keeps all producers alert through competition, so leave them alone.
2. Neoclassical school: Individuals know what they are doing, so leave them alone except when market malfunction. Its insistence on breaking phenomena down to individual level gives it a high degree of precision and logical clarity. But one can almost justify any govt/corp/individual actions with Neoclassical econ, if he is clever enough.
3. Marxist school: Capitalism is a powerful vehicle for economic progress, but it will collapse, as private property ownership becomes an obstacle to further progress.
4. Developmentalist tradition: Backward economies cannot develop if they leave things entirely to the market. The govt can identify and deliberately promote key industries along with infant industry protection to build an economy's productive capabilities.
5. Austrian school (Hayek): No one knows enough, so leave everyone alone. "The Road to Serfdom" in 1944 passionately warned against the danger of govt intervention leading to the loss of fundamental individual liberty. Individuals are NOT rational beings. It is only through spontaneous order of competitive market that the the plans of numerous economic actors reconcile with each other. 
6. (Neo-)Schumpeterian school: Capitalism is a powerful vehicle of economic progress but it will atrophy, as firms become larger and more bureaucratic. Creative destruction. Overly focus on techonology.
7. Keynesian school: What's good for individuals may not be good for the whole economy. He invented the field of macroeconomics. Savings needs to be invested, but there is no guarantee that they will equal. In an uncertain world, investors may suddenly become pessimistic about the future and reduce their investments, leading to more savings than needed. Investment will be high enough for full employment only when animal spirits of the investors are stimulated by new tech, financial euphoria and other unusual events. A speculative market is where buying and selling are driven by expectation of what other people expect.
8. Institutional school: Individuals are products of their society, even though they may change it rules. In neoclassical econ, the only cost is the cost of production. However NIE emphasizes the costs of organizing our econ activities i.e. transaction costs. 
9. Behaviouralist school: We are not smart enough, so we need to deliberately constrain our own freedom of choice through rules. We try to be rational but our ability to be is very limited, e.g. heuristics. 

Chapter 5: Who are the econmic actors? 
- The dominant neoclassical view is that economics is the science of choice. However,corporations and government, not individuals, are the most important economic decision-makers, and they don't make decisions like individuals. 
- Internatioanl org with money: World Bank, IMF, etc; Int. org that set rules: WTO (the only one with one-country-one-vote rule), BIS, etc; Int. org that promote ideas: UN agencies and ILO offers a forum for discussions, technical assistance, voluntary declarations/conventions.
- Individuals have multiple selves, can be easily manipulated via education/religion/mass media/advertisement. Once poor people accept that the reach must deserves it and they can be rich too if they try hard enough, the life of the rich becomes easier.

Chapter 6: Output, income and happiness
-  GDP measures value added. GDP - depreciation = net domestic product (NDP).
-  World GDP in 2023: 106T USD, with US accounting for 28T (26%), China 18T (17%), Germany 4.5T (4%), Japan 4.2T, India 3.6T, UK 3.4T.
