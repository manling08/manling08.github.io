Chapter 1: Life, The Universe and Everything
- Economics is a study of the economy rather than rational human choice.
- Money is a symbol of what others in the society owe you, or your claim on particular amounts of the society's resources.
- The most common way to get money is to have a job. To understand jobs, we need to know about skills, technological innovation and international trade.
- There are lots of transfers of money in the ecoconmy.
- In standard economics textbooks, there is little recognition of production, e.g. how the factory is organized, how to control workers or deal with trade unions, and how to systematically improve tech via research.

Chapter 2: From Pin to PIN
- Adam Smith: ultimate source of increase in wealth lies in the increase in productivity through greater division of labor.
- Capitalism is an economy in which production is organized in pursuit of profit rather than for own consumption. It is organized by capitalist, who own cpital goods (or means of production).
- In Smith's time, most people did not work for capitalists, and child labor is perfectly fine. Today in rich countries, about 10% are self-employe, 15-25% work for the government, and the rest work for capitalists.
- In Smith's time, Markets were largely local except for key commodities that were traded internationalls (e.g. sugar, slaves, or spices). The small-scal firms creates perfect competition. Most banks issued their own notes to a particular person with a unique value and was signed by the cashier issuing it. It was only in 1759 that Bank of England started issuing fixed-denomination notes. And in late 18th century (Smith time) fully printed notes were issued. 
- Gold standard means the paper money issued by central bank is freely exchangeable with a specified weight of gold/silver. The US Fed kept gold equivalent to 40% of the value of currency it issued.
- 3/4 of French didn't have access to banks (saving and borrowing) until 1860s. Stock markets had been in existence for a couple of centuries by Smith's time.
- However great an economic theory it may be, it is specific to its time and space. To apply it fruitfully, we need a good knowledge of the tech nad institutional forces that characterize the particular segment we try to analyze.
