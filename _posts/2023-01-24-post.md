As a profound thinker.

Introduction
- Since the resounding failure of the planned economics (due to failure to consider incentives!), the market economy has become the dominant model for our societies. The power of elected officials are restricted.
- Defining common goods requires value judgement. A thought experiement imagining you were not born helps.

Chap 1 Do you like Economics
- Our intuition frequently plays tricks on us. We are all vulnerable to, and yield to, certain heuristics and beliefs. Heuristics are rules of thumbs for thinking, shortcuts to an answer to a question. Most of the time we don't see the indirect effects or see the full picture. We all take responsibility for our limited understanding of economic phenomena, our desire to believe what we want to believe, and our relative intellectual laziness, and our cognitive biases.
- People tend to bias towards identifiable victims. Economists need to also consider unidentifiable victims, who suffer from the secondary/indirect effects (vs the patient that receive both primary and secondary effects).
- Market is just one of the many ways to manage scarcity. However it is more efficient than bribery, favoritism, and wars. For example, waiting in line may mean the price was set too low and thus the supply will always be in shortage.
- Populism can be defined as the exacerbated eagerness to exploit the ignorance and prejudice of voters.
- We should tolerate some mistakes by public officials and be constructive. 

Chap 2 Moral limits of the Market
- We resist pricing life, choosing lives between ours and others (in autonomous driving settings). Is that becuase we cannot admit who are actually are? 
- Banning organ markets limits the supply of donors. And yes the poor may be lured to sell their kidney without knowing the full consequence. It is unequal, but trying to hide from reality is no way to solve the problem of poverty. Lastly the existing of an organ market increases the opportunities (on top of stealing, robbing, enslaving, etc.) of mafia-like extortion. 
- Martial arts is banned not just to protect the comtatants, but also to protect ourselves against being disturbed by the collective enjoyment of such events.
- Luckily smart market designs like paired kidney exchange without money exchange can help, which is what economists aim to achieve.
- Indignation can easily lead to assertion of our preferences to the detriment of other's freedom (e.g. homosexuality), and lack of thorough reflection. We can better understand the foundations of morality and our fears about the commercialization of certain domains.
- Does the market threaten social cohesion, given it promotes 'selfishness'? Not necessarily. All market participants need to build TRUST in order to trade. Separating social bonds from commercial activities can prevent a villager having to bear with bad bread made by the local baker all his life.
- The rich's success: is it effort or circumstances? We have little empirical knowledge about the connection between merit and success in most countries. In absence of information, anyone can believe what they want.

Chap 5 Economics on the Move (aka irrational behaviors)
- In a narrow economic model where behaviors are only guided by stick and carrots, nobody should ever vote as no one's vote will solely change the result.
- Individuals are part of social groups, and those identities affect the image she/he wants to project to others and to himself. (To what extent are we free and truly 'ourselves'? We are a combination of all the tags we give to ourselves like.) If his community has a bad reputation, he will have little incentive to behave well because he will not be trusted anyway. (Vicious cycle.)
- The limit of incentives: (1) when outcomes cannot be attributed clearly; (2) intrinsic incentives are crowded out (e.g. paying for blood donation); (3) when clashed with social values (e.g. some societies do not allow capital punishment). 
- Homo Darwins: We sometimes take seemingly wasteful resources or risks to send a signal to our rivals or the person we want to attract.
- Homo religiosus: If clergy was financed directly by believers rather than the state or religious hierarchy, it will serve believers and religion better; Judaism required the reading of Torah and promoted literacy, which increased the Jewish community's human capital.

Chap 6 Towards a Modern State
- When technical decisions likely to be poorly undrestood by the electorate, a democratie process can be problematic.
- In France, government expenditure is still more than 57% of GDP. Meanwhile, Germany, Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, and Canada are all countries with social-democratic traditions that have preserved both a high level of public services and cost-efficiency. Government can be an arbitrator than a major provider of employement and producers of goods/services.
