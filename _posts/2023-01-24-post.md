As a profound thinker.

Introduction
- Since the resounding failure of the planned economics (due to failure to consider incentives!), the market economy has become the dominant model for our societies. The power of elected officials are restricted.
- Defining common goods requires value judgement. A thought experiement imagining you were not born helps.

- Our intuition frequently plays tricks on us. We are all vulnerable to, and yield to, certain heuristics and beliefs. Heuristics are rules of thumbs for thinking, shortcuts to an answer to a question. Most of the time we don't see the indirect effects or see the full picture. We all take responsibility for our limited understanding of economic phenomena, our desire to believe what we want to believe, and our relative intellectual laziness, and our cognitive biases.
- People tend to bias towards identifiable victims. Economists need to also consider unidentifiable victims, who suffer from the secondary/indirect effects (vs the patient that receive both primary and secondary effects).
- Market is just one of the many ways to manage scarcity. However it is more efficient than bribery, favoritism, and wars. For example, waiting in line may mean the price was set too low and thus the supply will always be in shortage.
- Populism can be defined as the exacerbated eagerness to exploit the ignorance and prejudice of voters.
- We should tolerate some mistakes by public officials and be constructive.
