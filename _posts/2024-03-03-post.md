- Money is the greatest show on earth.
- Everyone is biased. The second-hand knowledge can never be as compelling as your experiences.
- Americans spend more on lottery tickets than movies, music, video games, sporting events and books combined. "You don't understand the dream we have because you are already living in it."
- Few people make financial decisions purely based on spreadsheet. Personal history, ego, pride, marketing and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you.
- Before WW2, most Americans worked till death. The entire concept of being entitled to retirement is at most two generations old.
