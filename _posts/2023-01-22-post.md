我会给这本书三颗星。前半部分还不错，语言如诗一样优美，在描述儿时的街上和学校经历是非常细腻、动人，而让人叹息的——由于学校的不接地气，他恨之更甚于街上的暴力！这种由街区分裂带来的vicious cycle还有什么希望解决呢？然而后半部分颠来倒去地讨论fear of body plunder，极度情绪化，字里行间溢满了对白人的嫉恨、被害妄想，对问题本身又不去进行深入分析，如同在酒吧里被人拽住大吐苦水。是的，人类的悲欢不相通，但我们能有事说事吗？大家是应该坐下来讨论问题、认识问题，从而能寻找到解决方案。一味抱怨并声称这事没法解决，是想怎么样呢？他不是一个人。至少读这本书，我看到一部分黑人的所思所想——怨念不止才是真正的societal deathbed.

这个月的第二本英文书。坚持每个月读两本、中文书不设上限，听起来很不错 ：）

- *Streets*. When I was your age the only people I knew were black, and all of them were powerfully, adamently, dangerously afraid. They loved the music (and violence) because that's the only thing that says they were the masters of their own lives. Maybe I would take another human body to confirm myself in a community. Hate gives identity.
- *Family education*. I grew up in a house drawn between lov and fear. My father beat me when I got bullied or I bullied others. Parents lived on their nerves because so many had lost a child, somehow to the streets, to jail, to drugs, to guns.
- *Schools*. What did it mean to, as our elders told us, 'grow up and be somebody'? I don't know any French and nothing around me suggested I ever would, so why I taking a French class? I sensed that the schools were hiding something. The schools were designed to sanctify failure and destruction ('He could have stayed in school!')
- *Books*. When I was in trouble at school, my mother would make me write about it. Why did I feel the need to talk at the same time as my teacher? Why did I not believe my teacher was entitled to respect? etc. 
- History books spoke of black people as sentimental 'firsts' - first black five-star general, first black congressman, etc.
- Throughout his colleges, he tried to weaponize the history, to prove black superiority and find their pride.
- She kissed me, and the ground opened up, swallowed me, buried me right there in that moment.
- It is the last bottle of wine that you have just uncorked but do not have time to drink. It is the kiss that you do not have time to share, before she walks out of your life.
- There was more out there than I had ever hoped for, and I wanted you to have it. 
- THe killer of Prince Jones was a force of nature, the helpless agent of our world's physical laws.
- The fact of history is that black people have not liberated themselves strictly through their own efforts.
- The price of error is higher for you than for your countrymen, and so that America might justify itself, the story of a black body's destrcution must always begin with his or her error.
- I have spent much of my studies searching for the right question by which I might fully undersatnd the breach between the world and me...It is not our biological features, but the actual injury done by people intent on naming us.
