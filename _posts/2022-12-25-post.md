We study economics, so that we can provide dignity and amplify humanity.

- Th go-go years of global growth, fed by trade expansion and China's amazing economic success, may be over, what with China's growth slowing and trade wars igniting everywhere. Slow growth is nothing new in the affluent West, but the rapid fraying of the social contract is particularly worrying. Answers to these problems take more than a tweet, so there is an urge to just avoid them.
- Only 25% people trust economists, while trust in weather forecasters was twice as high in the UK.
- Economists are more like plumbers; we solve problems with a combination of intuition grounded in science, some guesswork aided by experience, and a bunch of pure trial and error.
- Economists tend to adopt a narrow notion of well-being. And yet all of us need much more than income/consumptionto have a fulfilling life: the repect of community, the comforts of family and friends, dignity, lightness, pleasure. The focus on income is what persuades so many of us that the whole world is waiting at the door to take our well-paying jobs. It is what has led to a single-minded focus on restoring the Western nations to some glorious past of fast economic growth, and makes us deeply suspicious of those who don't have money and terrified to find ourselves in their shoes.
- Politicians toke fears by abusing facts. Unfortunately, people exposed to the false claims tend to vote for her, and this persisted after her statements were fact-checked in front of them.

<Immigration>
- First, the wage difference actually has little to do with whether or not people migrate. While it is obvious that many people deperate to get out from where they are, the enduring puzzle is why so many others don't move when they can.
- Second, there is no credible evidence taht even relatively large inflows of low-skilled migrants hurt the locals.
- Information is not the binding constraint. When the NGO provided a randomly chosen growth of people with info about the availability of jobs in Bangladesh, the info alone had absolutley no effect. Among people given the financial support who chose to make the trip, only about half went back during the next monga season, despite their personal experience of finding a job and making money.
- Low-skilled migration might push up the demand of labor as it slows down the process of mechanization, i.e. the promise of a reliable supply of low-wage workers makes it less attractive to adopt labor-saving tech.
- Migrants may complement rather than compete with native labor as they are willingt to perform tasks natives are reluctant to carry out, e.g. mow lawns, babysit, lowering prices of such services, which helps natives workers and frees them to take on other jobs.
- Few companies hire those who just walk in and ask for a job, even if they say they would accept a lower wage. German firms did not replace their existing Germany staff with the benefit of familiarity, but sometimes hire Czech migrants instead of new native workers they don't know.
- Why people don't move? (1) Social network is deeper and stronger at home, seriving as a very desired insurance. (2) Need for a connection/recommendation. (3) Overestimate the risks. Any loss relative to the natural benchmark (letting things be) is particularly painful. (4) 
- The fear of failure is a substantial disincentive for embarking on a risky adventure. After all, most want to protect an image of ourselves as intelligent, hard-working, morally upright individuals.
- Wage gain from migration is lower for workers with a high school degree vs for high skilled workers.
